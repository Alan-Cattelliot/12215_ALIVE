Tool for Small Craft Hull Construction and Scantling ISO12215-5



__Jun-2020. 12215 ALIVE !1 is a JavaScript DEMO platform (also referred as “the App” in this document) that delivers a pre-organized and comprehensive information of the standard requirements,
specifically to any user’s case.__

The 12215 ALIVE! App DEMO is developed by A.C.E. CATTELLIOT ENGINEERING, in the purpose of support and partnership with users. It guides users through the evaluation process via __an online interface__
that gather all the necessary tools to define your case the easiest way.

The user is guided in his application of the standard, in a way compatible with ISO9001 application.  The user gets in an instant all the applicable requirement in the field covered by the DEMO, and some usefull extras .

It implements the following revised ISO12215-5 requirements :

* 5.General requirements
  * 5.1 Material
  * 5.2 General procedure for scantling determination

All the entries and output variable defined in the standard are translated into simple formulars, allowing a wide range of users, including __manufacturer, designers, architects, professionals and
non-professionals__.

Follow this link to launch the demo : [link to 12215 ALIVE on BINDER!](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Alan-Cattelliot/12215_ALIVE/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2FFuture_version_1.ipynb)

It may take a little while, at the very first start, for the online server to be built. In background, it's a complete virtual machine that is created for you. Please note that it may happens that the internet page stay blank after the server is launched. Wait a litte more before reloading the page to get the app.

## DEVELOPMENT PLAN

__The achievement will be for the app to deliver the information both interactively and into the form a pre-built templates. In gold, the expected delivery date of a server that will be
accessible to any kind of terminal java-compatible.__

Our efforts are focused in merging new computing technologies together, allowing for the App to be located on a distant virtual server, exchanging in real-time with the user, to guide him through the process of evaluation.
__Three technologies__ have been selected and implemented in the App for this purpose :

* __Interactive user entry__    
  * Automatize user entry when possible. Limit to the minimum the number of operations required to fill formulars with user data.
* __Real-time mode__    
  * See by yourself the effect of parameters on the evaluation and get a sharp sense of the standard formulas and coefficient to the point when ideas of optimization will come to your mind.
* __Print with reference mode__  
  *Database of reference linked with the output functions of the App. With this functionality, the App, under the woods, deliver up to date evaluation, and will continue to stitch to the 12215 has the standard will
    evolve in the future, with a minimum of code re-writing.
