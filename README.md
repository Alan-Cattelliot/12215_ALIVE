![Github](/images/image002.png)

> __Jun-2021__. 12215 ALIVE ! is a java application (also referred as __“the App”__ in this document) that select, organize and report, to your needs, the requirements of the ISO-12215 Small Crafts Design & Scantlings; in his last version.

The 12215 ALIVE! App DEMO is developed by A.C.E. CATTELLIOT ENGINEERING, in the purpose of finding support and partnership for the developpment of a complete technical and regulatory service for crafts under 24meters/78feet. 

The user is guided in his own application of the standard via __an online interface__, in compliancy with the record management system of ISO9001 version 2015. As a result, you are able to produce, in an instant, __a simple verification or an evidence of compliancy__ for local administration.

It implements the following revised ISO12215-5 requirements :

* 5.General requirements
  * 5.1 Material
  * 5.2 General procedure for scantling determination

### Applications
All the entries and output variable defined in the standard are translated into simple formulars, allowing a wide range of users, including __manufacturer, designers, architects, professionals and non-professionals__.

 Please use the GITHUB website to pull a request. We will give you full support to get your hands on the DEMO.

### Important notes
 * Craft under 2.5meters are how of the scope of the standard, although they have been implemented in the DEMO version, resulting in faulty analysis. This is not the case on the full version, where practical analysis in some restrained cases can be performed. It serves the purpose of challenging some features in the standard for future use.
 * Part 7 of the standard is still a matter of discussion. The performance analysis of multihulls shown in the demo are based on monohull formulas. This approximation is acceptable for most of the production  multihulls, but is mostly innacurate for light sailing multihulls. Special cares are taken in the full version.

### Known issues
 * Wait for the image to be downloaded, then double tap or click on the image section below the download button, in section *DESCRIPTION*, to get the full image display.
 * Also double tap or click on the image section below the get it button, in section *GET YOUR APPLICATION FORM*, to get the full image display, after the image has been displayed.
 * When using scrolling selection, the first item of every menu is not reactive, even if clicked, for the first time of use. Simply choose another option, then re-select the first item in the menu you wanted to choose at first place.



## DEVELOPMENT
Plans for a better experience in quality insurance of leisure crafts

![Github](/images/image020.png)

> __September, 2021 Official launch of the BETA version__. __"The App"__ will deliver cross informations of the 12215 books, both interactively and into the form a pre-built templates, accessible to any kind of terminal java-compatible, until jan-2022. During the BETA period, we will fully support you in your applications, and let you drive __"The App"__ in your garage.
 
Our efforts are focused in merging new computing technologies together, allowing for__"the App"__ to become a reliable and easy-to-get 12215 assessment of __crafts under 24meters/78feet__. Located on a distant virtual server, exchanging in real-time with the user, guiding him through the process of evaluation, we aim at giving to __the advantage of an highlighted view of what can be made__, in the mandatory field of the standard.

__Three technologies__ have been selected and implemented in the DEMO for this purpose :

* __Interactive user entry__    
  * Automatize user entry when possible. Limit to the minimum the number of operations required to fill formulars with user data.
* __Real-time mode__    
  * See by yourself the effect of parameters on the evaluation and get a sharp sense of the standard formulas and coefficient to the point when ideas of optimization will come to your mind.
* __Print with reference mode__  
  * Database of reference linked with the output functions of the App. With this functionality, the App, under the woods, deliver up to date evaluation, and will continue to stitch to the 12215 has the standard will evolve in the future, with a minimum of code re-writing.
    
### General context
Compared with the 2008 version, structural analysis of the 12215 demands the user an additional effort to get confidence in the choice of the method. In cause, the “trial and error” approach for boat assessment.

As the standard has reached his end of presumption of conformity the 1st of July, we have implemented several assessment procedures, until a consensus is attained together with official recommendations, that would allow us to go further.

### Upcoming

![Github](/images/image021.png)

* __Method 4__
  * makes a link to other standards - ISO,ASTM -, which are specifically applicable to material testing. Habilitated test centers operate under ISO9001 rules are thrusted sources. Local university laboratories or independent test centers may also produce quality results, depending on their experience in the industry field.

__Method 4 will be available with usage restrictions to be acknowledged by the users.__

* __Method 5__
  * is used for a pair of decades in boat industry. Most naval engineering cabinets master FE analysis. From their theorical knowledge and practical experience of the manufacturing, they are capable of producing the more realistic results. The unification of their own method, together with the FE implementation in the standard, pose, in the end, un-solved questions to users.

> An attempt to propose solutions is under currently under validation study, through collaboration in the study of composite panels with the EF method.

__A practical implementation of the method 5 is scenarized to be put in the App in January, 2022__.
 
## CONTRIBUTION AND PARTNERSHIP

> Engineering is the hardest part. Creating the online server means contracting the virtual machines, creating the online repositories arborescence, uploading the application, testing, making access to clients, giving access to site manager. The deployment in such an environment challenges frequently of our knowledge. 

We would like to invite you to catch the wind, and join us. We design numerical tools to push forward boats technologies. Behind the scene, high end computing technics requires specific competence, outside our walls. We offer you any appropriate partnership to go further away, together. 

![Github](/images/image006.png)

> The 3 components of our approach, for each of which we will focus our greatest efforts.

### Composite application

> The material characteristics taken into account are, most of the time, the thickness, the fiber orientation, the moisture level and the temperature. Advanced layering technologies  aim a gain in material strength, balancing efforts inside the material. The method 1 and method 2 cannot be used in relevant cases in the industry. A solution is given in the standard, but the difficulty of its use poses an issue.

For the more mechanical or material oriented engineers of you, we will enjoy every suggestion of __CLT analysis algorithm.__ Method 3 is a more detailed method applicable to __any bi-directional layered composite manufacture__. It concerns most of the boat production, since the industry of Plaisance is essentially plastic-based. 

It is a pain that it has not been possible to find numerical tools to validate unbalanced material compositions with low fiber content, as it is most of the time. More, to use this third method, one requires a lot of trustworthy data, that lacks today. Until we are able to overcome these issues, our position is that the finite element analysis should be prefered.

Thank you for your attention.
