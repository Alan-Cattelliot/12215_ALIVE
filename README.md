> __Jun-2021__. 12215 ALIVE ! is a java application (also referred as __“the App”__ in this document) that select, organize and report, to your needs, the requirements of the ISO-12215 Small Crafts Design & Scantlings; in his last version.

 12215 ALIVE ! App DEMO is developped by A.C.E. CATTELLIOT ENGINEERING, in the purpose of finding support and partnership, for the developpment of a complete technical and regulatory service for __Hull Construction and Scantling of crafts under 24meters / 78feet__. 

The user is guided in his own application of the standard via __an online interface__, in compliancy with the record management system of ISO-9001 version 2015. As a result, you are able to produce, in an instant, __a simple verification or an evidence of compliancy__ for local administration.

It implements the following revised ISO-12215 part 5 requirements :

* 5.General requirements
  * 5.1 Material
  * 5.2 General procedure for scantling determination

### Applications
All the entries and output variable defined in the standard are translated into simple formulars, allowing a wide range of users, including __manufacturers, designers, architects, professionals and non-professionals__.

First step in the application of the standard, the DEMO gives the flavor of 12215ALIVE! __Get tuned and stay alert, all the functionnalities will be unveiled before the official launch !__

it's __a complete virtual machine__ that is created for you, everytime you need it, wherever you are, taking advantage of just an smartphone in your hands and an internet connexion in the air. 

### What you need to get the job done, in a nutshell, is :

- [ ] Access "the APP" directly when clicking on the link below

Direct link to the DEMO : [link to 12215 ALIVE !](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Alan-Cattelliot/12215_ALIVE/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2FFuture_version_1.ipynb)

- [ ] Check the `Lauching server` printout in terminal view

The online server is being built. The terminal view gives the status of the server creation and configuration. 

- [ ] Enjoy __12215 ALIVE !__ 

After the start of the application, it may happens that the internet page stay blank after the BINDER server is launched. Please wait a little more before reloading the page to get the app.

 Please use the GITHUB website to pull a request. We will give you full support to get your hands on the DEMO.

### Important notes
 * Craft under 2.5 meters are out of the scope of the standard, although they have been implemented in the DEMO version, resulting in faulty analysis. This is not the case on the full version, where practical analysis in some restrained cases can be performed. It serves the purpose of challenging some features in the standard for future use.
 * Part 7 of the standard is still a matter of discussion. The performance analysis of multihulls shown in the demo are based on monohull formulas. This approximation is acceptable for most of the production  multihulls, but is innacurate for light sailing multihulls cruisers and racers. Special cares are taken in the full version.

### Known issues
 * Wait for the image to be downloaded, then double tap or click on the image section below the download button, in section `DESCRIPTION`, to display the full image.
 * Also double tap or click on the image section below the `get it` button, in section `GET YOUR APPLICATION FORM`, to get the full image display, after the image has been displayed.
 * When using scrolling selection, the first item of every menu is not reactive, even if clicked, for the first time of use. Simply choose another option, then re-select the first item in the menu you wanted to choose at first place.

Sorry for the convenience, we're seeking solutions for this.

## DEVELOPMENT
Plans for a better experience in quality insurance of leisure crafts

![Github](/images/image020.png)

> __September, 2021 Official launch of the BETA version__. __"The App"__ will deliver cross informations of the 12215 books, both interactively and into the form a pre-built templates, accessible to any kind of terminal java-compatible, until jan-2022. During the BETA period, we will fully support you in your applications, and let you drive __"The App" into your garage__.
 
Our efforts are focused in merging new computing technologies together, allowing __"the App"__ to become a reliable and easy-to-get 12215 assessment of every __crafts under 24meters / 78feet, including racers__.

Make use of virtual machine to lower the cost of edge technologies, exchange datas in real-time under supervision, be assisted through the process of evaluation. we aim at giving to __the advantage of an highlighted view of the whole mandatory requirements of the standard__.

__Three technologies__ have been selected and implemented in the DEMO for this purpose :

* __Interactive user entry__    
  * Automatize user entry when possible. Limit to the minimum the number of operations required to fill formulars with user data.
* __Real-time mode__    
  * See by yourself the effect of parameters on the evaluation and get a sharp sense of the standard formulas and coefficient to the point when ideas of optimization will come to your mind.
* __Print with reference mode__  
  * Database of reference linked with the output functions of the App. With this functionality, the App, under the woods, deliver up to date evaluation, and will continue to stitch to the 12215 has the standard will evolve in the future, with a minimum of code re-writing.
    
### General context
Compared with the 2008 version, structural analysis of the 12215 demands the user an additional effort to get confidence in the choice of the method. In cause, the “trial and error” approach for boat assessment.

As the standard has reached his end of presumption of conformity the 1st of July, we have implemented several assessment procedures, until a consensus is attained together with official recommendations, that would allow us to go further.

### Upcoming

* __Method 4__
  * makes a link to other standards - ISO, ASTM -, which are specifically applicable to material testing. Habilitated test centers operate under ISO9001 rules are trusted sources. Local university laboratories or independent test centers may also produce quality results, depending on their experience in the industry field.

__Method 4 will be available with usage restrictions to be acknowledged by the users.__

* __Method 5__
  * is used for a pair of decades in boat industry. Most naval engineering cabinets master FE analysis. From their theorical knowledge and practical experience of the manufacturing, they are capable of producing the more realistic results. However, the unification of each of their own methods, together with the FE implementation in the standard, poses, in the end, un-solved questions of interpretation to users.

> A solution is currently under validation study, through collaboration in the study of curved composite panels with the EF method plugged into __"The App"__.

__A practical implementation of the method 5 is scenarized to be put in the App in January, 2022__.
 
## CONTRIBUTION AND PARTNERSHIP

> Engineering is the hardest part. Creating the online server means contracting the virtual machines components, creating the online repositories arborescence, uploading the application, testing, making access to clients, giving access to site manager. The deployment in such an environment challenges frequently of our knowledge. 

__We would like to invite you to catch the wind, and join us__. We design numerical tools to push forward boats technologies. Behind the scene, high end computing technics requires specific competence, outside our walls. We offer you any appropriate partnership to go further away, together. 

![Github](/images/image006.png)

> The 3 components of our approach. We will focus our greatest efforts for each of which.

### Application to composite manufacturing

> The material characteristics taken into account are, most of the time, the thickness, the fiber orientation, the moisture level and the temperature. Advanced layering technologies  aim a gain in material strength, balancing efforts inside the material. The method 1 and method 2 cannot be used in relevant cases in the industry. To deal with, __Method 3 CLT analysis__ A has been implemented in the revised standard.

Method 3 is a more detailed method applicable to __any bi-directional layered composite manufacture__. It also concerns the boats production using non-wooven polyester in his composition for better finish quality. Wich is widely the case, as the industry of Plaisance is essentially plastic-based. For the more mechanical or material oriented engineers of you, we will enjoy every suggestion of algorithm that takse into account layered composition of different materials.  

It is a pain that it has not been possible to find numerical tools to validate unbalanced material compositions with low fiber content, as we would have been able to demonstrate the true advantages in term of strenght and durability of these composition. An additional difficulty arises with the need of trustworthy data in the 3 dimensions of the material which are barely available, even for offshore racing projects, like IMOCA's boat. Until then, our position will be that the finite element analysis should be prefered, with extreme caution.

Thank you for your attention.
